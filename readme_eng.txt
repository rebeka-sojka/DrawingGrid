Drawing Grid

Firstly, you have to choose your game settings.
You can do so by dragging pins with your mouse.

When you're satisfied - press Enter.

The "drawing grid" will appear and you can start drawing your own shapes!
To create a shape you have to click on any grid point and keep clicking
while you dont have 3 or 4 points that create together a triangle or a 4-edged plygon.
If you have these points click once again on any of them and your shape will come to life.

Every new shape that you havent drawn yet, will increase your score by 1.

You can reset your game at any point by pressing the Escape button.
